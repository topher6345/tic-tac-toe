# Tic Tac Toe

Play Tic-tac-toe in your browser.

I wrote this to learn [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## `yarn deploy`

Deploys the app using (gh-pages)[https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages]
